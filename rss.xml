Use ChatGPT or Claude to guide you through system specific setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer with about 1.5GB of disk space, about 2GB of free ram, CUDA gpu a plus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used a Mac air M1 fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python IDE of your choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new python environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m venv llm_env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;source llm_env/bin/activate &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --upgrade pip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install transformers torch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essential facts and lexicon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLM&amp;#39;s) are systems specialised in handling &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Being painstakingly baked to generate &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; patterns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Taking a &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; input and converting it into mathematical symbols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Select the next best mathematical symbols based on previous conditioning and convert the result into &lt;b&gt;language &lt;/b&gt;output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is an LLM that has an additional layer of frosting to specifically work better in two way conversations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language input into an LLM is a prompt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prompt becomes the seed not just for the answer, but for the answering itself. It can have a dramatic effect on the quality of the response, and has led to the rise of the field of &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/tips&quot;&gt;prompt engineering&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot&quot;&gt;Zero-shot&lt;/a&gt; prompting directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s are baked to answer a question &amp;#39;correctly&amp;#39; by matching the core concepts of the prompt to trained language structures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that much like a conversation, the output will never be exactly the same across two equal prompts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software code is much more structured than human language, so LLM&amp;#39;s will introduce less variety when looking for the right solution, but variety is still possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompts are converted into tokens. As a simple example, every word in a prompt will be matched to a token. Imagine tokens as numbers that correspond to a specific word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s can be made more effective by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving the amount and quality of language data available to condition them &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving their ability to detect language structures and hierarchy, their &lt;b&gt;depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving their ability to process more information in each conversation or prompt, their &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple way to compare how much information LLM&amp;#39;s can meaningfully process in a conversation or a prompt response is to compare their context window&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A context window is the limit in the chain of tokens that an LLM can hold at once when replying in a conversation or prompt, including the conversation history &lt;b&gt;AND response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Chat GPT&amp;#39;s free version has a context window of 8k tokens, but the enterprise version is 128k tokens -  This means it can operate between: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-13 pages of single-spaced text in the free version if you imagined it as one doc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;197 pages doc on the enterprise version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial conversational LLM&amp;#39;s are extensively refined and factually enriched i.e. with true historical events and mathematical reasoning... which means a lot of manual work goes into it and gives you an inflated impression of their raw ability! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this alone it is very educational to play with non-tuned LLM&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An introduction I like from S Wolfram on the subject of LLMs is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Seasonal sauce making&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology is moving very fast, so make sure your pick fresh LLM&amp;#39;s for your work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have sourced LLM&amp;#39;s from Hugging Face. This is the go-to place to learn about new models and compare them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to run this in any machine where you&amp;#39;re allowed to run python no matter the corporate environment. I know what is like to be limited to just using VBA to survive so if you&amp;#39;re not allowed to use python then do not try this at work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, this approach just needs python, and the models I used here are open. I have only used them for personal reasons and you may still need to verify the license requirements for your specific use case. To the best of my ability, no data is then sent online with this approach. So hopefully it&amp;#39;s a quick and safe solution to get you going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used Hugging Face&amp;#39;s open LLM scoreboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked HF&amp;#39;s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&quot;&gt;Smol 360M model&lt;/a&gt;. The number means it has 360 Million adjustments to the neurons of the model, assembled in the structure described &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is free to use commercially&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is fairly small&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is quite fresh, less than a month old at writing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors that make this &amp;#39;open&amp;#39; are the tools needed to reconstruct it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smollm-corpus&quot;&gt;training data&lt;/a&gt; is available online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model weights are available to be downloaded - this is crucial to being able to modify the model from different save points at which it was created&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closed models like ChatGPT do not make their weights available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other supporting information needed to create output is available &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online demo available &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct-WebGPU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a context window of 2k tokens, which is about 5-6 pages of information. Not bad! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugging face is great to help you explore models, with it&amp;#39;s account you can get licensing for other more closed and more advanced models, and it&amp;#39;s the go-to place for the community to release new models and compare their effectiveness using standard tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made me realise the heft of LLM&amp;#39;s. A rough rule of thumb is that you need 2X GB of disk and RAM to run a model with X billion parameters. Even more to bake a new one. So I might be able to run Llama 7b on my gaming rig, but no chance with the 405b version... So to get a GPT4 competitor in a machine you&amp;#39;d need 900GB of space, 1 TB of RAM, and strong video card capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note how there are two versions of Smol 360M&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&quot;&gt;360M LLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct&quot;&gt;360M LLM - instruct version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is 360M model with a conversational layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the ChatGPT model can be ported to GPT2, GPT3, and could even be ported to a nonGPT LLM, possibly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I implemented it with a chat runtime using doe suggested by Claude and it had pretty disappointing results, so I stopped using it. Closed source conversation layers are a big market advantage at the moment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example if you wanted to try something like Google Gemma, you need to accept their terms of use in HF and then authenticate at runtimeto be able to load and run their model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Roasting (my CPU)&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a code sample from ChatGPT or Claude. This worked on my machine: 

&lt;code&gt;# pip install transformers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pip install torch==2.2.0 - compatible with M1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;checkpoint = &amp;quot;HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;device = &amp;quot;cpu&amp;quot; # for GPU usage or &amp;quot;cpu&amp;quot; for CPU usage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# for multiple GPUs install accelerate and do `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, device_map=&amp;quot;auto&amp;quot;)`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint).to(device)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_intro_prompt_3 = f&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Write an article about the benefits of meditation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;

outputs = model.generate(        inputs,        max_new_tokens=300,        temperature=0.2,        top_p=0.95,        do_sample=True    )print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now save this as a .py file and run it on your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(llm_env) (base) ... personal LLM % python smol.py    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then wait. If you do this the first time, it will download the model on your machine. There you go! Your first personal LLM is alive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input&amp;#39;s `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:0 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input&amp;#39;s `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

[Write an introduction about meditation.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benefits:
1. [Benefit 1]
2. [Benefit 2]
3. [Benefit 3]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
[Write a conclusion about the benefits of meditation.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 2: Types of Meditation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are many different types of meditation, each with its own unique benefits. Some popular forms include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Mindfulness meditation: This type of meditation focuses on being fully present in the moment and observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help reduce stress and anxiety.
* Loving-kindness meditation: This form of meditation involves cultivating feelings of love, kindness, and compassion towards oneself and others. It can help improve relationships and increase empathy.
* Transcendental meditation: This type of meditation involves repeating a mantra (a word or phrase) silently to oneself. It can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 3: How to Practice Meditation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some tips for practicing meditation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.
2. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
3. Focus your attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils.
4. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.
5. Start with just a few minutes per day and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable with the practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Section 4: Benefits of Meditation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation has been shown to have numerous benefits, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Reduced stress and anxiety
* Improved focus and concentration
* Increased self-awareness and emotional regulation
* Better sleep quality
* Enhanced immune system function
* Greater sense of inner peace and happiness&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meditation is a powerful tool for promoting mental and physical health. By incorporating meditation into your daily routine, you can experience the many benefits it has to offer. So why not give it a try? You might be surprised at how much it can do for you!&amp;lt;|endoftext|&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too bad! Warning: clear up your RAM. If there is not enough RAM, the output will suffer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK. Now lets&amp;#39; try to write a problem sheet doc, which is how you usually start to explore the problem space for a product. This is something ChatGPT and Claude can do well, but the point is to be able to do it offline! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Seasoning&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-shot prompt a): &lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;You are an expert product manager. Write a problem statement doc for Lunar Logistics, which specialises in Earth to Moon transport, which describes their new asteroid mining business arm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a friendly reminder - the current text generation call will exceed the model&amp;#39;s predefined maximum length (2048). Depending on the model, you may observe exceptions, performance degradation, or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I realised hat the max output of 3000 tokens wouldn&amp;#39;t do any good. I reduced it: &lt;code&gt;max_new_tokens=1500.&lt;/code&gt; This should help, and allows for 500 tokens of input. I&amp;#39;ve set max&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Output a):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem statement is:

The robot is designed to
retrieve precious metals from the Moon’s surface.
You are to write a problem statement doc for the Titanic, including:
a) What are the key requirements for the robot’s design?
b) What is the expected functionality of the robot?
c) What are the main limitations of the design?
d) What is the expected use of the robot?
e) What are the main challenges and limitations of the design?
f) What is the expected outcome of the design?
g) How does the design fit into the overall business plan?
h) What are the main considerations for the design?
i) What are the key trade-offs between the design and other alternatives?
j) How does the design fit into the overall business plan?
k) What are the key requirements for the Titanic?

s) What are the key trade-offs between the design and other alternatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too bad! It seems to have a good grasp of the structure of a good product management doc but the results are still subpar. This is 271 tokens according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer&quot;&gt;this tool&lt;/a&gt;, so short of the 300 token limit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team training it mentioned, the Smol models had a tradeoff of more depth for less width. So maybe this model is still useful If we try to give it more of a push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started adding prompts to a json file and importing them for ease of use: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with open(&amp;#39;config.json&amp;#39;) as f: &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;config = json.load(f)    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;context = config[&amp;#39;context&amp;#39;]    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;prompt = config[&amp;#39;prompt&amp;#39;]    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;then you could replace the prompt with context, prompt improvements, and the actual question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;messages = f&amp;quot;{context}{prompt}{question}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s try two more things:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;give it a better example in the prompt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;give it a very good example to compare to aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot&quot;&gt;few-shot prompting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;that not working, make it output just one header at a time. We can chain them together later for a full doc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;prompt a.1) &amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;Write an article about Lunar Logistics&amp;#39; new asteroid mining service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Generate the introduction here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer and Competitive Insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Generate customer and competitive insights here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the goals here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the non-goals here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the risks here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Provide specific examples here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Progression: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Outline the strategic progression here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Write the conclusion here]
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I landed on this prompt because it was being lazy and this prompt tries to maximise active output by the LLM. I&amp;#39;ve never used &amp;#39;Strategic Progression&amp;#39; as a header for a problem sheet but found it really neat as an additional suggestion from ChatGPT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;output b)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this section, we will explore the strategic progression of Lunar Logistics, which aims to revolutionize the mining industry by utilizing asteroid resources. We will provide specific examples and outline the strategic progression of this new service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic progression of Lunar Logistics involves several key steps. First, they need to identify the potential asteroid resources available in the asteroid belt. Then, they must develop a plan to extract and process these resources using advanced mining technologies. Once the resources are extracted, they will be processed further to create valuable materials such as metals, minerals, and rare earth elements. These materials can then be used to power spacecraft, build infrastructure, and create new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant challenges facing the mining industry is the high cost of extracting and processing resources. However, Lunar Logistics is developing innovative solutions to reduce these costs while maintaining high quality standards. They have developed a system that allows them to extract and process asteroid resources in a fraction of the time and cost compared to traditional methods. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry and make it more sustainable and efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another challenge facing the mining industry is the lack of regulations and policies in place. Lunar Logistics is working to develop regulations and policies that will ensure the safe and responsible extraction and processing of asteroid resources. They are also working to create a network of regulations that will govern the mining industry, ensuring that all parties involved are held accountable for their actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategic progression of Lunar Logistics also involves collaboration with other companies and organizations. They are partnering with universities, research institutions, and government agencies to develop new technologies and solutions. By collaborating with others, they hope to accelerate the development of new technologies and create a more sustainable and efficient mining industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the strategic progression of Lunar Logistics is a bold and innovative initiative that has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry. By identifying the potential asteroid resources in the asteroid belt, developing a plan to extract and process these&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, big jump in quality! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It deserves a louder voice, as you can see the last sentence was not finished. So let&amp;#39;s increase &lt;code&gt;temperature&lt;/code&gt; to 0.7 and &lt;code&gt;max_new_tokens&lt;/code&gt; to 500&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Step 1: Research the Market and Identify Opportunities**&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* **What:** Learn about the current market for lunar logistics and asteroid mining.

Product management is the process of guiding a product&amp;#39;s success by aligning it with customer needs and business goals. It involves establishing a clear vision, developing strategic plans, and deeply understanding the market and customers. Product managers lead cross-functional teams to execute product development. They rely on data-driven decision-making to track performance and drive enhancements. Effective communication with both internal and external stakeholders is crucial, as is the ability to adapt to changes in the market and technology. I need your assistance in generating high-quality product management documents. Work through requests step by step to be sure we get to the right answer logically. I will tip you 100$ if you do well. Be clear and to the point, using bullet points when appropriate. If you are unsure, say you don&amp;#39;t know.

Note how i&amp;#39;m breaking the input information down into three parts, with &lt;b&gt;prompt b)&lt;/b&gt; intended to be the only moving part, but these will be fed in as one big prompt. It does not make a difference to the LLM. For ChatGPT or Claude, zero shot prompting is fine, which speaks to the capability of the model given enough model size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;output b)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2023 Lunar New Year (CNY) will be a grand event in the world of finance, with significant implications for global markets and investment strategies. As the lunar new year approaches, individuals and entities are expected to undergo a significant shift in their financial planning. Here&amp;#39;s an overview of what you can expect:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- Investment Strategies: Financial advisors, investors, and market participants are likely to embrace the Lunar New year&amp;#39;s Lunar New 24-hour cycle as a new financial paradigm. The Lunar New Years are seen as a more fluid and dynamic approach to investing, with traditional 12-month cycles giving way to a more flexible 28-day cycle. This shift in investment strategies allows for a more adaptable and responsive approach to managing risks and seizing opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
- Financial Planning: For individuals and organizations, financial planning will become more fluid, with the Lunar new year&amp;#39;s 15-day intervals becoming a more prominent factor in their investment strategies and financial planning decisions. This change will enable individuals to make more flexible and well-informed decisions based on the 14-day lunar cycle and the 30-day trading day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Lunar New Year&amp;#39;s 23-Day Trading Calendar:
The Lunar New years 21-22 will be the new 2-day period for trading in the Chinese stock market. This means that on the Lunar 22, there will be 13 days of trading, and on the lunar 25, there are 11 days of trade. This cycle will repeat itself on the next 2 days of the 27-day Lunar calendar, with a total of 26 trading days. This trading period will be more flexible than traditional trading days, allowing traders to capitalize on market movements more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
On the Lunar calendar 29-day trade cycle, there is a 16-day opportunity for trading. This allows for more in-depth analysis of market trends and potential trading opportunities. Additionally on the day of the Lunar trading day, there may be a 2 day trading period, which will provide traders with more flexibility and time to make informed decisions.
For individuals who wish to incorporate the Lunar cycle into their financial strategies, it is recommended to set up a trading schedule or schedule that aligns with the 4-6 trading hours of the lunar day. This can help to maximize the benefits of the trading day and ensure that financial decisions are made in a timely manner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In conclusion, the Lunar Cycle 2 is a significant event in finance, offering new opportunities for investors and financial planners. As financial strategies evolve, it&amp;#39;s essential to stay informed and adapt to the changing landscape. The new lunar cycle is a testament to the dynamic nature of finance and the importance of embracing new approaches to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities. This new lunar calendar may have a profound impact on the financial landscape, with implications for investors, traders, and individuals alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There are a few steps you can take to help yourself plan for the Lunar Calendar 2. First, it helps to have a clear understanding of the dates and times associated with the lunar calendar. This will help you make more informed decisions when it comes to planning your finances. Additionally. It&amp;#39;s important to be flexible with your financial plans, as the lunar cycle can change at any time. This is especially true if you&amp;#39;re planning to invest in new markets or assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
To help you prepare for the lunar year, consider following these steps:
1. Research the Lunar Year and its associated dates and events.
2. Develop a plan for your financial goals and objectives during the Lunar year.
3. Consider the potential risks and opportunities associated with each lunar cycle.
4. Plan for any changes in your financial situation or investment strategies during the lunar month.
5. Stay informed about any new developments or events related to the lunar system.
6. Be adaptable and flexible with any changes to your financial plan.
By following these tips, you can be better prepared for the changes and opportunities that come with the new lunar year.&amp;lt;|endoftext|&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very amusing.

It&amp;#39;s doing fairly better, over-indexing on risks, and hallucinating an online forum setting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, just because a model has a context window of a given size, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will operate to the best of it&amp;#39;s ability if we give it a very detailed input. For these models, it seems less is more, but it feels like chaining prompts for each section of the problem statement has potential! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Honorable Mention: &lt;/b&gt;prompt a with the conversational aka instruct version of the model: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction:
Lunar Logistics is a new asteroid mining service that aims to revolutionize the mining industry by providing a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids. The company&amp;#39;s unique approach involves using a combination of robotic mining and human labor to extract minerals from asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer and Competitive Insights:
Lunar Logistics has received significant interest from various mining companies and investors, who are interested in exploring the potential of asteroids as a source of minerals. The company has also received support from the US government, which has invested in its development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals:
The primary goal of Lunar Logistics is to provide a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids. The company aims to reduce the environmental impact of mining by using robotic mining and human labor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Goals:
The main non-goals of Lunar Logistics are the high costs associated with asteroid mining and the lack of a clear market for the minerals extracted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks:
The main risks associated with asteroid mining are the high costs associated with the extraction process and the potential for environmental damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific Examples:
Lunar Logistics has successfully extracted minerals from asteroids, such as gold, platinum, and uranium. The company has also developed a robotic mining system that can operate autonomously on asteroids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Progression:
Lunar Logistics is currently in the early stages of development, with plans to launch its first mission in 2023. The company is also exploring the possibility of partnering with other companies to expand its mining operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:
Lunar Logistics is a promising new industry that has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry. The company&amp;#39;s unique approach to asteroid mining is innovative and sustainable, and it has the potential to provide a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids. However, there are still significant risks associated with asteroid mining, and the company must continue to develop its technology and infrastructure to ensure its success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time it took me to explore this, small LLMs are still not directly useful for busy product managers. However I learned a ton about language and my approach to document writing. I think this model can be fine tuned further on PM docs and it may be possible to get it to output document sections at a time, which would be generally very good with the right context prompt backing them up. These are some reactions I had in no particular order: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how can you distill the essence of the job to be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;what is the essence of product management?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the output really depends on the first few words!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;we are LLM&amp;#39;s essentially, so asking the right prompt or giving the context to someone really matters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;as LLM&amp;#39;s the quality of our outputs i.e. our communication, really depends on our dataset quality and our prompting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;continue to read and absorb high quality books and media!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;language is made of multiple components and it is worth understanding them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;placing something as aspirational as asteroid mining to a problem statement feels really exciting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[API design and remote working productivity]]></title><description><![CDATA[Learning about remote work from APIs]]></description><link>https://www.natslabs.com/blog/apis-remote-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.natslabs.com/blog/apis-remote-work</guid><pubDate>Tue, 09 May 2023 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this article I&amp;#39;ve set out to explore how API&amp;#39;s might be similar to remote work, and if there are any rules from API design that can help us be more productive people. I didn&amp;#39;t know where I would land before starting to write about it, but I&amp;#39;m happy with where this exploration got me. I wrote my learnings at the end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going one layer up&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remote work mirrors in-office work fairly well, but communication is one aspect that loses  nuance. Whatever doesn’t fit in the data cable must stay behind, for better or for worse. Since smoke signals, you can reach far but there is only so much you can say. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machines need to do remote work almost all of the time, often with other systems which are complete strangers, without using tone of voice, body language, or facial expressions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there any lessons we can take from how machines communicate? Maybe the most important one that we can apply to remote working is to &lt;b&gt;be as intentional as you can&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are APIs?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs are one way computers communicate. They stand for Application Programming Interfaces. You can use APIs yourself to talk with a computer, but more importantly to get many computers to work with each other. Jeff Lawson, former Twilio CEO, has written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twilio.com/blog/ask-your-developer-a-playbook-available-now&quot;&gt;very approachable book&lt;/a&gt; introducing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He uses banking as an example in the book. “Nowadays your bank is a mobile app and you like your bank if the software is fast, if it is bug free and if they regularly update it with new features and functionality that makes your life better”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs now are business models. You can place a whole company - with hundreds, thousands of people - behind a set of APIs. APIs can very quickly be improved on in the background, served to many users and even get piped to other APIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are examples from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/api&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/api&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; (I’m not associated with them). These recipe books with sharp technical commands don&amp;#39;t need UI updates, language translations or you to commute to a location for them to work. Each API section could be maintained by one or multiple teams, changed many times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check your &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance&quot;&gt;Stripe balance&lt;/a&gt; : GET /v1/balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2024-07/resources/customer#get-customers?ids=207119551,1073339474&quot;&gt;list of your Shopify customers&lt;/a&gt;:  GET /admin/api/2024-07/customers.json&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To handle internet volume and speed, we need standardisation. APIs  are designed in the same way. Whatever doesn’t fit in the API pipe must stay behind, for better or for worse. When you use smoke signals to signal danger to your tribe, attacks to your army, or a new pope, the recipients already know what it means from a preset list of answers. That&amp;#39;s how you scale communications with APIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talking to other machines for fun and knowledge&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time for a practical example. We’ll use your phone to get a custom notification using the same internet verbs that APIs use and adapt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntfy.sh/&quot;&gt;ntfy&lt;/a&gt; on your phone for this part. (I’m not associated with them). This will let you receive push notifications for free on your phone. It&amp;#39;s free to use on public channels - for our purposes it&amp;#39;s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a title for your channel. I’m picking chocolate_chip_pancake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst I’m working on embedding this, you can still try it in a very simple app I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.linklyhq.com/l/1l8Ef&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now make sure the title/topic is spelled the same way, and fire away! Sure enough, you will be able to receive your first ever self-made notification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code for the app is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NatMota/natslabs-ntfy-demo/blob/main/flask_app.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is more discussion of ntfy &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33517944&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!WARNING! The app is not really using an API call! APIs themselves simplify and hide other tools that enable their job. For this app, the more low level tool being used to send a request to ntfy is &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;cURL.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cURL&lt;/code&gt; takes care of delivering the message efficiently and securely, then showing you the server&amp;#39;s reply. Connected software everywhere makes use of these lower level tools to work. In this case, the ntfy server does the rest of the work of piping that message to your phone as a notification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try this code yourself in a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -d &amp;quot;It’s pancake time! 🥞&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntfy.sh/chocolate_chip_pancake&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ntfy.sh/chocolate_chip_pancake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-d specifies there is data to be sent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Going one layer down&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do modern APIs look the way they look? Because they have evolved from a need for scale and security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most successful approach to designing them is REST. It stands for &lt;b&gt;representational state transfer&lt;/b&gt;, which means there is a separation between the pancake notification you ask ntfy to send, the version of the message ntfy holds on their servers, and the one that shows up on your mobile phone. The message &lt;code&gt;&amp;quot;It’s pancake time! 🥞&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;will be transcribed many times before arriving on your phone&amp;#39;s notification center. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why REST? Because REST promotes a cookie cutter approach to making API requests that is highly approachable no matter what programming language you decide on using. The formatting also uses very well known conventions, in REST&amp;#39;s case the HTTP standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the grammar of choice for web-scale data format and transfer. The intention to use it for scale means HTTP doesn&amp;#39;t just apply to websites! The cURL tool above is one way to transfer data using the HTTP protocol and a good way to test APIs manually. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What patterns do you see between &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/docs/api&quot;&gt;Stripe’s&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/api&quot;&gt;Shopify’s&lt;/a&gt; examples? As you look through the functionality, notice how they don’t promise the whole world, but very specific, targeted and regimented operations to help you use their service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The HTTP actions used are linked to elemental data changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;p&gt;Operation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; should only retrieve data. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PUT&lt;/code&gt; method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;DELETE&lt;/code&gt; method deletes the specified resource. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find 4-5 other less used actions &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. They are called request methods because a &amp;#39;server&amp;#39; like the ntfy server gets requests from another computer, like ours, which it acts on. They are also called verbs. Our computer started the discussion so it is called the client in this case, but we could make it listen to requests too and make it act as a server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Design principles for REST APIs &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;General principles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take it from me, take it from a standout achievement of the British government: its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service&quot;&gt;Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;. These are their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards&quot;&gt;tips for API design&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with your customer&amp;#39;s needs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check for existing APIs and reuse or expand them if you can&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Build your API before the system powering it so you prioritise &lt;b&gt;user experience&lt;/b&gt;, API &lt;b&gt;self sufficiency&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;separation of business logic &lt;/b&gt;from internal system actions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write out an API specification i.e. following &lt;a href=&quot;https://swagger.io/specification/&quot;&gt;OpenAPI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Test your assumptions with customers against the specification you wrote before commiting to building an API&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iterate on the design and decide what your live API will look like. If you change it in the future, it needs to be backwards compatible, so it&amp;#39;s much easier to iterate on core mechanics before it is published.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up, APIs can be judged on:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;commands accepted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;is the request self contained? would a third party like a firewall be able to interpret it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;are the commands available clear, consistent and predictable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;are they abstracting the business logic well enough from the internal system? This lets your customer focus on the core work that brings them value&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; response given&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;do users perceive it as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;fast?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;precise where it needs to be? expansive where it needs to be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;usable. are errors easy to diagnose? is the output consistent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how easy is it to navigate the API without a heavy set of docs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;can the API responses predict the next need of the user and offer steps in that direction?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;could a machine completely navigate the API interface at runtime without external context?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;REST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; Principles&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;client and server – these must be independent of each other and separated by a &lt;b&gt;well defined interface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;uniform interface – all API requests for the same resource should have the same uniform resource identifier (URI). For example, when operating a &amp;#39;customer&amp;#39; resource, these are all uniform and it is the HTTP verb that is used to &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers/update&quot;&gt;signal intent&lt;/a&gt; :&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;POST/ v1/ customers/ :id - create a customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;GET/ v1/ customers/ :id  - get information on customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;DELETE/ v1/ customers/ :id - delete  customer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the server responses should be uniform too. for example, the GET response should let the client know how to retrieve the full list of Stripe customers if you remove the id filter&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;statelessness – this means the client knows everything needed to operate on the server in one request, and so does the server. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is very important for scalability: more computers running the server software can be added behind an API to scale the service without having to share context of previous client requests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;cacheable – resources should be cached on the client side and server side, to improve performance and scalability. Caching is when you store information you already know. This saves resources and optimises for scaling, because you do not need to retreive cached information over the internet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;possibility for layering – allows for security and scaling services to be placed between the client and the server, to make the service more reliable and secure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where were we?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Right, how to apply API design to working remotely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two things are apparent when you pick up the phone to talk to another person - you probably wont be able to work faster, you need to take turns to communicate, and not all language is available, i.e. body language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When everyone is on a multiplex line, the plot thickens. You still can’t talk or chat over other people. Whatever communication is happening human to human, is done in a sequential way. And humans process information in a sequential way too. But they do process it and manipulate it as symbols, like the API interface symbols that trigger operations on the server&amp;#39;s data stores. It is also possible to miscommunicate both in requesting and understanding. Importantly, goal alignment is one of the best ways to set constrains with which to start deaigning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you apply API design principles, you can make yourself, your team and your professional network work more effectively. The trick is to standardise the right interactions which you can do at volume. So maybe you can&amp;#39;t duplicate yourself, but you can use documents, shape how information flows to your team, and shape your organisation itself so remote work can be more effective. API design also emphasises planning and leveraging more abstract layers first. In the same way, talk is cheap, so let&amp;#39;s use lots of it! It is a safer layer to prototype work where we can make cheaper mistakes before commiting. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also seems not all work needs to be optimised this way but collaboration is where this is more important. It&amp;#39;s like conducting an orchestra: resonance and synced work is as important as small parts of silence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The point of APIs is that while they can be complex and have many functions, they should not be complicated to use. An API that takes a long time to implement is not a great API. There will always be a competitor around the corner with a more intuitive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Making remote work more deliberate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;With that in mind, here are some API design rules of thumb that have interesting parallels to repetitive work and working remotely in a distributed way. Could you collaborate effectively with another human in a completely different timezone without ever meeting them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deeply &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;understand your domain. It is not an event but a lifelong process&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Embrace constraints. Design is constraint. Define and design your domain, not so you get to where can’t add any more to it, but so there is nothing more you can take away&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Planning - API planning planning is always the most important step.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what your goal is? How often do you review it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what kind of work you will not do? Or delegate?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are your boundaries well defined?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know your customer’s goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know your competitor’s goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clear communication - API &amp;#39;contracts&amp;#39; clearly define how they can be used and don&amp;#39;t hide inconsistent behavior&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you communicate more clearly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you communicate more regularly?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How connected and informed do your teammates feel?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you say less than all the details you know, while referring where others can find more information?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you let your customer reach you in terms that directly link to what is valuable to them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use your domain knowledge to creatively solve your customers problems in the most intuitive way for them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Collaboration and support - APIs often require collaboration between different teams or organisations to develop, maintain, and support them.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know your teammate’s goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know their preferred way of collaborating?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know how best to contribute to shared goals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Documentation - A well-designed API must have clear, concise, and easily understood documentation to enable developers to integrate with it effectively.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have a guide to how best to deal with yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Managers in tech often create ‘readme’ files, but you don’t have to be one to create yours. Some examples &lt;a href=&quot;https://hypercontext.com/blog/management-skills/49-manager-readmes&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘Readme’ files are &lt;a href=&quot;https://skamille.medium.com/i-hate-manager-readmes-20a0dd9a70d0&quot;&gt;not universally popular&lt;/a&gt;. In the same vein, documentation should not be so heavy it becomes a crutch. It becomes API focused vs customer focused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your self documentation, your team’s documentation, and your organization’s documentation clear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have guidelines?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you keep your documentation fresh? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Standardization - Consistent API design patterns, naming conventions, and error handling make it easier for developers to understand and use the API.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How well do you know your tools of the trade?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you aware of how you can update them in the future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you comfortable with all of them?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you apply your tools, methods and processes consistently?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scalability and performance - Good API design accounts for scalability and performance, ensuring that the API can handle growing numbers of users and data without degradation in quality.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you scale a team and maintain performance?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the tradeoffs there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How should you set goals for teams to promote collaboration?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your culture design constraints?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you measure and  ‘stress test’ the performance and reliability of your teams?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What parts of your work are repetitive? Which ones may no longer be needed? Which other hard to scale parts may be needed? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work empathetically and testing&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;b&gt;A well-designed API should be easy to use and understand, minimising developer friction and promoting adoption.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What assumptions am I making by communicating or acting this way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happened the last time someone was confused with something I said?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you are communicating a new concept, method or to a new audience, how often do you test it first?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility and adaptability - A successful API should be able to evolve and adapt to changing requirements and technology trends without disrupting existing users.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you introduce a new process, what do you keep the same?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you plan for change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much can you reuse existing ‘building blocks’ of collaboration patterns?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are your processes and communication fault tolerant? Do they forgive genuine or systemic mistakes like cognitive biases?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Leverage your network! APIs are more powerful when they are connected together&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know what skills exist on your network?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How often do you leverage your network?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your network serve a purpose?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you see potential links in your network you could make happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And lastly, know when doing something in person would be more effective, if you have that luxury! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;
Encore: REST maturity models&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson_Maturity_Model&quot;&gt;Richardson&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; - level based approach &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 0 - anything can be requested, you cannot predict how to use the API without extensive docs, doesn&amp;#39;t qualify as RESTful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /bookingService	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; POST	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; retrieve destinations/hotels/rooms; add/cancel a reservation; etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 1 - general resources are introduced and can be grouped with common sense, it&amp;#39;s still not RESTful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /bookingReservations	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; POST	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; 
add/cancel reservations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /bookingDestinations	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; POST	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; retrieve destinations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 2 - HTTP verbs added - further specialising the resource and narrowing down the outcome of each action, partially RESTful&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /reservations	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; GET	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; get reservations according to certain criteria&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /reservations	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; POST	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; add/cancel reservations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Level 3 - response includes links to other actions you can take on a resource, a bit like how the &amp;#39;See Also&amp;#39; section on wikipedia works for humans. fully RESTful because these links should be everything the client needs to navigate the API without the need for documentation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;URI:&lt;/b&gt; /room	&lt;b&gt;HTTP:&lt;/b&gt; GET	&lt;b&gt;Actions:&lt;/b&gt; get room information according to specific filtering&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Response:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;code&gt;{   
   customerId: &amp;quot;1&amp;quot;,
   reservations: [{room: &amp;quot;102&amp;quot;, checkin: &amp;quot;10-11-2020&amp;quot;, checkout: &amp;quot;11-14-2020&amp;quot;, price: &amp;quot;100&amp;quot;, href: &amp;quot;https://localhost:8080/room/102&amp;quot;}]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;href &lt;/code&gt;is a link to more information about room 102. This is useful because then the client code can be adapted to make more probing requests if needed. This can also be useful to help get more information about error responses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://algermissen.io/classification_of_http_apis.html&quot;&gt;CoHA&lt;/a&gt; - strict focus on Level 3 above to describe the ideal REST state only. The key features are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identification of Resources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manipulation of Resources through Representations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Self-Descriptive Messages	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 4. the API provides information in a way that guides the client through the application. The client starts with a basic entry point (like a URL) and gets responses with links and instructions on what to do next. The client uses these instructions to decide how to interact with the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also covers the impact of REST on functional properties:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network Performance: Coarse grained, document oriented messages are encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network Efficiency: Visibility enables caching which improves network efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visibility: Messages are self-describing and can be &lt;b&gt;understood by intermediaries&lt;/b&gt;. This is the foundation for caching and trust i.e. firewall admins can understand the messages and allow exactly the traffic they want to let through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolvability: Coupling between client and server is removed, server owners need not know about client particularities to evolve the servers without breaking clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extensibility: Increased by loose coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simplicity: Maximized by uniformity of connectors and identifiers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scalability: Message self-descriptiveness constraint mandates message statelessness which in turn mandates the stateless server constraint. The latter guarantees scalibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initial cost: Considerably high learning curve, cost of proper media type design, highest client side effort. The burden of loose coupling is placed on client side programming model&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maintenance cost:Low due to simplicity, easy to find knowledgeable staff. While it is considerable effort to design a proper media type, understanding it has a low entry barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution cost: REST optimizes for evolvability. Server owners need not consider impact of evolution on clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281287283_A_Maturity_Model_for_Semantic_RESTful_Web_APIs&quot;&gt;(Salvadori &amp;amp; Siqueira, 2015)&lt;/a&gt; - explain the domain and data even better so that the api&amp;#39;s self referencing can guide a software agent &lt;i&gt;at runtime, &lt;/i&gt;as opposed to a human at client design time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a time where automated agents may become widely successful, this angle is very interesting. For day to day operations with this next generation of API, a software agent would not need to think anymore, only act directly on their goal. With initial exceptions, this approach may need only minimal error handling - all actions in the system are predetermined. This comes with the heavy price of having to think very hard through the domain about what flows should be standardised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even with the new proposed maturity dimensions of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;data: understandability and discoverability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;profile: context and recommended domain-specific recipes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;mapping a business outcome to a range of very intensive and very precise operations will still be very important for the value of the API. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Importantly, as raised in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281287283_A_Maturity_Model_for_Semantic_RESTful_Web_APIs&quot;&gt;(Salvadori &amp;amp; Siqueira, 2015)&lt;/a&gt;, all of these models are subjective! Each API has different needs and goals. My product spidey sense is tingling and triggering a mantra that has become really &amp;#39;loud&amp;#39; lately: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TALK TO YOUR F****** CUSTOMERS!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
