So I was curious to find if API design could also be used to improve team collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remote Communication Challenges&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s very interesting to debug collaboration when you are distributed across different timezones. Whatever doesn‚Äôt fit in the data cable must stay behind, for better or for worse. And there&amp;#39;s at least three factors I&amp;#39;ve noticed we may be taking for granted when getting into an online call:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;nuance&lt;/u&gt;: you may miss out on at least half of the body language depending on the camera angle, tone of voice, facial expressions, and timing delays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;time&lt;/u&gt;: it may feel like you&amp;#39;ve just spoken to them, but actually a ton of time can pass between the last call you&amp;#39;ve been on together had you been working desk to desk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;distortion&lt;/u&gt;: your conversation may have mutated since you last spoke, especially if other collaborators are involved. Given nuance and time, you or your partner may have progressed down an unexpected direction &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long distance communication was figured out all the way back to smoke signals. But this placed &lt;u&gt;clarity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;at a premium. Given the three factors above, the job becomes 1. reducing the difference in information between persons A and B and 2. managing this successfully over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long distance collaboration has been solved for computers. Are there any lessons we can take from how computers communicate? Maybe the most important one is: &lt;u&gt;be as intentional as you can&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Introduction to APIs&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs are one way computers communicate. They stand for Application Programming Interfaces. You can use APIs yourself to talk with a computer, but more importantly to get many computers to work with each other. Jeff Lawson, former Twilio CEO, has written a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48716700-ask-your-developer&quot;&gt;very approachable book&lt;/a&gt; introducing them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He uses banking as an example in the book. ‚ÄúNowadays your bank is a mobile app and you like your bank if the software is fast, if it is bug free and if they regularly update it with new features and functionality that makes your life better‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs are business models now. You can place a whole company - with hundreds, thousands of people - behind a set of APIs. APIs can very quickly be improved on in the background, served to many users and even get piped to other APIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are examples from &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/api&quot;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; and from &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/api&quot;&gt;Shopify&lt;/a&gt; (I‚Äôm not associated with them). These recipe books with sharp technical commands don&amp;#39;t need UI updates, language translations or meetings for them to work. Each API section could be maintained by one or multiple teams and changed many times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Examples&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check your &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance&quot;&gt;Stripe balance&lt;/a&gt; : GET /v1/balance&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-rest/2024-07/resources/customer#get-customers?ids=207119551,1073339474&quot;&gt;list of your Shopify customers&lt;/a&gt;:  GET /admin/api/2024-07/customers.json&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These APIs are purposefully created to handle internet scale volume and speed, and whatever doesn‚Äôt fit in the API pipe must stay behind. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you use smoke signals to signal danger to your tribe, attacks to your army, or a new pope, the recipients already know what it means from a preset list of answers. That&amp;#39;s how you scale communications with APIs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from the Wikipedia page for smoke signals I found too funny not to include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misuse of the smoke signal is traditionally considered to have contributed to the fall of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Zhou_dynasty&quot;&gt;Western Zhou dynasty&lt;/a&gt; in the 8th century &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCE&quot;&gt;BCE&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_You_of_Zhou&quot;&gt;King You of Zhou&lt;/a&gt; was said to have had a habit of fooling his warlords with false warning beacons to amuse &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bao_Si&quot;&gt;Bao Si&lt;/a&gt;, his concubine.&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signal#cite_note-4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Talking to other machines for fun&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time for a practical example. We‚Äôll use your phone to get a custom notification using the same internet verbs that APIs use and adapt. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Download &lt;a href=&quot;https://ntfy.sh/&quot;&gt;ntfy&lt;/a&gt; on your phone for this part. (I‚Äôm not associated with them). This will let you receive push notifications for free on your phone. It&amp;#39;s free to use on public channels - for our purposes it&amp;#39;s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Think of a title for your channel. I‚Äôm picking chocolate_chip_pancake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whilst I‚Äôm working on embedding this, you can still try it in a very simple app I built &lt;a href=&quot;https://l.linklyhq.com/l/1l8Ef&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Now make sure the title/topic is spelled the same way, and fire away! Sure enough, you will be able to receive your first ever self-made notification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The code for the app is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/NatMota/natslabs-ntfy-demo/blob/main/flask_app.py&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. There is more discussion of ntfy &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33517944&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;!WARNING! The app is not really using an API call! APIs themselves simplify and hide other tools that enable their job. For this app, the more low level tool being used to send a request to ntfy is &lt;b&gt;&lt;code&gt;cURL.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cURL&lt;/code&gt; takes care of delivering the message efficiently and securely, then showing you the server&amp;#39;s reply. Connected software everywhere makes use of these lower level tools to work. In this case, the ntfy server does the rest of the work of piping that message to your phone as a notification. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can try this code yourself in a terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl -d &amp;quot;It‚Äôs pancake time! ü•û&amp;quot; &lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ntfy.sh/chocolate_chip_pancake&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ntfy.sh/chocolate_chip_pancake&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-d specifies there is data to be sent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Applying API Principles to Collaboration&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a meeting cadence is just the tip of the collaboration iceberg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will also have to accept you will not have perfect communication. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a given for APIs. Between the art and science of designing one, integration, and deployment - API communication failures are not exceptions, they are the rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We covered a fun practical example to illustrate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;how APIs work in everyday life and how easy it is to get started with them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;the role of servers: behind every request you make to an app, there is a server waiting to answer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;real-time notifications: you can start seeing how much information APIs process in real time like in this case to deliver your every-day messaging&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How can we relate what we learned to cross border collaboration?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Communicating is the &amp;#39;easy&amp;#39; part üòÆ‚Äçüí®&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up the team to understand what it means is not! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you make sure your team&amp;#39;s knowledge is growing positively over time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does your team work unite under a clear common vision?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;Be intentional:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentionally communicate &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;priority&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentionally communicate &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;nuance&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Be open to more openly expressing how you&amp;#39;re feeling or how you think the other person is feeling to compensate for the lack of body language, tone and timing information that you cannot get in a call &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intentionally communicate how you want the other person to &lt;u&gt;&lt;b&gt;mentally prepare&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/u&gt;. Do you want a critical evaluation or creative collaboration? Think about it in terms of the six thinking hats example &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mindtools.com/ajlpp1e/six-thinking-hats&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it&amp;#39;s a difficult task to collaborate on, aim to &lt;b&gt;complete it together with your partner in one go&lt;/b&gt;. It is worth booking a separate, longer meeting as long as you are clear about what you want to accomplish&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shorter loops: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use async communication tools like docs to shorten the loops of communication and provide a compensatory effect for teams who are working at different speeds or timezones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;During intense projects, look to balance focused, uninterrupted work periods with more frequent, clear moments of collaboration &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be relationship-driven&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is key to understand how you can best enable the rest of your team to do well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes me indispensable to my team? How can I amplify this even more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What work that I create benefits my whole team the most? How can I do more of that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look to understand your working styles. It doesn&amp;#39;t take that long and adds visibility to positive dynamics you can reinforce and frictional dynamics you can diagnose&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is important about how we want to work together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we best support each other?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create contracts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understand yours and your team-mate&amp;#39;s differences and commit to valuing them and integrate them effectively&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What specific habits do you want to practise together?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much time should you expect between responses given your time zone difference?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be prepared for communication to fail - it is not a matter of &lt;i&gt;if&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;when&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specialise and separate delegation when possible&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not let conflict to chance. In most situations, conflict is about unblocking the use of limited resources, so see it as another side of collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have a good process to handle conflict? &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NzF-otDuBWKC2GShJKcFsxCyabK1V3skQwCMU89tDmY/edit#&quot;&gt;Here&amp;#39;s&lt;/a&gt; a great example&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smoke signals eventually become noise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All you know is based off past memory. How can you keep an open mind to new information? How well can you adapt to it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can a 3rd party help you make sense of a conflict? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the benefit of the doubt more often than you normally do. This will help you overcome noise in your communication and collaborate more effectively in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Next up: API Design Principles Applied to Remote Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a taster of what we will cover on the next article:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do modern APIs look the way they look? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;REST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design principles for REST APIs &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[First-time app development with new AI tools]]></title><description><![CDATA[First-time app development with new AI tools]]></description><link>https://www.natslabs.com/blog/first-time-app-development-with-new-ai-tools</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.natslabs.com/blog/first-time-app-development-with-new-ai-tools</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Sep 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;My mum is a busy childminder and as an immigrant, one of the enduring challenges of the job is communicating effectively in another language. Childminding is regulated the same way as schools and nurseries in the UK and all settings are taught to report on child development the same way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parents are also vested in receiving effective updates on how their child did during the day. But child care is demanding and demands practicality, which goes against the order and process of regular observations, especially when those are in a second language. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after learning of recent popularity of LLM based coding tools like Cursor and Replit Agent, I decided it was time to try to create an app to alleviate my mum&amp;#39;s problem. It&amp;#39;s really cool how others are hooking these tools with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFqgVXVXPX0&amp;t=17s&quot;&gt;voice commands&lt;/a&gt;. Even teens are confidently &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Har0qHtTRY8&quot;&gt;creating&lt;/a&gt; in this new way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This app is not on the appstore yet üòÖ but I can now sideload it on my iPhone with Xcode! I also didn&amp;#39;t know it costs ¬£80 a year to host it on the appstore! üò± &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Inspiration and design constraints&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had two sources of inspiration and additional constraints in mind:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Nikita Bier had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhnfZhJWCWY&quot;&gt;just featured&lt;/a&gt; on Lenny&amp;#39;s product podcast, and I wanted to imitate Gas&amp;#39; concept of not having to type at all for you to use the app. I also wanted to surface this &amp;#39;aha&amp;#39; moment as soon as possible, and added it as the tagline for the logo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I hate habits by themselves. I love games. So I thought of adapting habit tracking and gaming concepts from apps like Duolingo to try to make child observations more fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I believe this will work better by making it product lead. So I&amp;#39;m favouring parents over childminders in the design ie. aim for a daily report every day and building with the aim of ultimately making the app parent-led.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I also researched the UK government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/early-years-foundation-stage-framework--2&quot;&gt;child development framework &lt;/a&gt;for childcare providers and how other apps handle observations. While it feels kind of forced to link any given activity to an EYFS development milestone, it is what it is and having a consistent stream of observations that can be built into reports is a key pain point for childminders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So I decided: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The app will only allow one to add today&amp;#39;s and yesterday&amp;#39;s observations, to promote simplicity, urgency and fresh data&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Childminders can add a photo and tap on descriptors based on emotional, time of day and EYFS milestone categories&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- At the end of the day, childminders can press &amp;#39;share&amp;#39; and the app would prepare an observation message so it would be appealing and easy to consume for parents. Voice observations do not translate well to emails so they were not included this time but there&amp;#39;s a lot of potential for summarisation and nuance with ML here as photos can really tell 1000 words, and voice notes would compliment them really well. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setup&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I downloaded Cursor, which has a generous 2 week trial on Claude 3.5. My aim was to blindly try to make it to the Appstore, but the project needs more time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I had Xcode already, so I just had to download additional device emulators&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I used my mac M1, and at later stages I used my iPhone to test drive the app&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Getting to use Cursor for the first time was pretty seamless. I came prepared with a prompt text file which I dutifully fed to it&amp;#39;s context window:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;We are making a simple iOS app for childminders to track children&amp;#39;s activities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;It looks like a game with a playful and engaging interface.
There is minimal typing required; updates are made using preset moods and activity icons.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Each activity update is completed with a photo submission.
The app uses a colorful and animated interface to make tracking fun and intuitive.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
There is a progress bar that fills as daily activities are completed, encouraging consistent updates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Users earn points and badges for completing daily and weekly activity goals.
The app has a library of predefined activities (e.g., nap time, playtime, meals) that the childminder can select with a single tap.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
There is a &amp;quot;Submit Update&amp;quot; button that finalizes the entry after selecting the mood, activity, and adding a photo.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
After the update is submitted, the app stores the information and allows the childminder to view progress in a streak-based system.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The app compiles all daily or weekly updates into a downloadable PDF or a poster-style photo that visually summarizes the child‚Äôs activities.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
There are notifications and reminders that encourage childminders to complete their daily updates.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
The app&amp;#39;s home screen shows the current streak, upcoming tasks, and earned badges.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Complete this app in its entirety, ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for childminders to track children&amp;#39;s activities efficiently and enjoyably.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t just complete code, it can add, delete, and help you understand code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    - Cursor works like this:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Code understanding by converting it to LLM-readable embeddings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional code analysis fairy dust&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s to understand what you&amp;#39;re asking, respond with code, and keep track of the conversation and file history in their context window&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Setting up Xcode to show a preview was really painful. It took me over an hour and killed the initial enthusiasm. It finally worked when I created a dummy project and filled it with the codebase Cursor had initially created&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I also had no idea about how to code apps, so that added to the frustration of getting a preview to work in Xcode. ChatGPT was trying to help in circles. Google wasn&amp;#39;t finding help that was relevant enough. So it took trial and error - and it&amp;#39;s a common complaint about Xcode&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I am not checking all the code and how it works üò±. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Created a free logo with Shopify&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/online-store/images/hatchful&quot;&gt;Hatchful&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The app still looks very raw but it&amp;#39;s great to see a product in your hands! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here it was in full swing. I wanted the progress bar to complete for three key parts of the day, i.e once all the kids were checked in. After testing with my mum, I found the interface was too complicated. So I decided to cut down and simplify the designs, even though I would still want to make it look more like a video game at a later point. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already dark mode native! üòú&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo taking functionality on the app as seen from my phone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Learned lessons&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Developing apps is hard! So many files for such a simple app!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- As Cursor is not fully efficient, I was working at maybe 30% of the speed of me if I knew how to program in Swift. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Phone screen real estate is small and a challenge to design for!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- App permissions can just be configured in a file?!!!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cursor is neat but being dependent on Xcode is a fairly big barrier to a fully replicable environment setup. When an LLM gives me some advice, it sucks to try to find it in the Xcode UI, especially since the LLM may be hallucinating in an effort to be helpful. So Cursor was less powerful for app development specifically in my experience although it&amp;#39;s UI indications were correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- It would be nice to see what the change proposed by Cursor is going to look like before I accept it. It feels like the feedback loop is broken here and could be much tighter, where I can fully tailor the change in preview before committing to the codebase&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Save as often as you can ie in Github, because some proposed changes can completely alter the design! So I&amp;#39;d love to learn how to develop in specific parts of the app, resting easy that Cursor will not edit another area&amp;#39;s design or code logic as an aftermath&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- The state of attention window of the LLM is important to &amp;#39;getting you&amp;#39; more effectively. I learned to initialise a new session by asking Cursor how all the loaded files work together first. The more warmed up it is, the less context you have to give it. So these coding sessions build up in intensity after one hour because both you and the LLM get into a flow state&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Sometimes Cursor is lazy! It suggests code changes but does not apply it to the files. Bad LLM! Bad!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- In my app development case, sometimes Cursor created completely new or duplicate files üò§ it was frustrating to ask for a change for the 3rd time and seeing no changes in the preview only to find out Cursor started creating it&amp;#39;s own little world &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- You can end up in very semantically heavy, circular and pedantic design changes because you don&amp;#39;t understand the code and the design elements used. This can lead to you thinking you&amp;#39;re one step from the the almost perfect design you took 7 prompts to craft, only for the LLM to ruin it with a cascade of well meaning but misguided changes that create a blast zone in the area. This is because LLMs are also not deterministic, as explained in my article &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.natslabs.com/blogs/compact-llms-product-work/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- So, if you can get a specialised coding LLM, this could also have a massive impact in quality. It would be a cool challenge to start encoding app designs as well - I wonder how much good quality training data of app design is out there vs web designs which come for free with crawling&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cursor is not very adapted to Swift, as far as I&amp;#39;ve seen. It creates code that leads to a lot of compilation errors and this confounds changes and breaks productivity. Because you don&amp;#39;t understand the code, sometimes you&amp;#39;re at the mercy of whatever the solution the LLM thinks of is, and this can go on for a few long loops before you solve it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- You really have to understand how the files talk to each other at a minimum to guide Cursor to make the right changes and navigate build errors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- One general prompt that worked very well was &amp;#39;Ask me questions until you&amp;#39;re 95% sure of how to implement this&amp;#39; for more complex changes. It gave me space to answer the questions and then it acted in that next prompt immediately!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Try to have the designs ready on Figma for instance and load them in as code. Let Cursor focus on the data and logic, rather than try to describe something that you can probably reproduce in much higher fidelity on Figma&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;m not sure the trial is profitable for Cursor, they may remove it in the future, but it sure was a lot of fun to code more natively instead of copy pasting it from an LLM. If they can tighten the feedback loop for app design this can become downright addicting&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trying out compact LLMs for product work]]></title><description><![CDATA[I tried to find a safe way to run an LLM on your personal computer without licensing or data transfer worries. ]]></description><link>https://www.natslabs.com/blog/compact-llms-product-work</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.natslabs.com/blog/compact-llms-product-work</guid><pubDate>Sun, 11 Aug 2024 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;h1&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to recreate a personal assistant environment for product managers who:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not have access to, or are not allowed to place sensitive data on online services&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to use software for free&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Know python but have no time to learn related tools &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;May be concerned with software licensing restrictions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are curious about LLM&amp;#39;s and are exposed to them already&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do not have a powerful machine to run LLM&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to automate the crappy first version of a doc and overcome writer&amp;#39;s block faster&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Mise en place&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m using an apple silicon mac. Use ChatGPT or Claude to guide you through system specific setup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer with about 1.5GB of disk space, about 2GB of free ram, CUDA gpu a plus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Used a Mac air M1 fine. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python IDE of your choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a new python environment:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m venv llm_env&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;source llm_env/bin/activate &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;python -m pip install --upgrade pip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install transformers torch&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Essential facts and lexicon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large language models (LLM&amp;#39;s) are systems specialised in handling &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Being painstakingly baked to generate &amp;#39;correct&amp;#39; &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; patterns&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Taking a &lt;b&gt;language&lt;/b&gt; input and converting it into mathematical symbols&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Layer the next best mathematical symbols based on baking presets and convert the result into &lt;b&gt;language &lt;/b&gt;output&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is an LLM that has an additional layer of frosting to specifically work better in two way conversations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language input into an LLM is a prompt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prompt becomes the seed not just for the answer, but for the answering itself. It can have a dramatic effect on the quality of the response, and has led to the rise of the field of &amp;#39;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/introduction/tips&quot;&gt;prompt engineering&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/zeroshot&quot;&gt;Zero-shot&lt;/a&gt; prompting directly instructs the model to perform a task without any additional examples to steer it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s are baked to answer a question &amp;#39;correctly&amp;#39; by matching the core concepts of the prompt to trained language structures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that much like a conversation, the output will never be exactly the same across two equal prompts, except for example when working on coding prompts due to much more predictable language structures in coding&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prompts are converted into tokens. As a simple example, every word in a prompt will be matched to a token. Imagine tokens as numbers that correspond to a specific word. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s can be made more effective by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving the amount and quality of language data available to condition them &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving their ability to detect language structures and hierarchy, their &lt;b&gt;depth&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;improving their ability to process more information in each conversation or prompt, their &lt;b&gt;width&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One simple way to compare how much information LLM&amp;#39;s can meaningfully process in a conversation or a prompt response is to compare their context window&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A context window is the limit in the chain of tokens that an LLM can hold at once when replying in a conversation or prompt, including the conversation history &lt;b&gt;AND response&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, Chat GPT&amp;#39;s free version has a context window of 8k tokens, but the enterprise version is 128k tokens -  This means it can operate between: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;12-13 pages of single-spaced text in the free version if you imagined it as one doc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;197 pages doc on the enterprise version&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial conversational LLM&amp;#39;s are extensively refined and factually enriched i.e. with true historical events and mathematical reasoning... which means a lot of manual work goes into it and gives you an inflated impression of their raw ability! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this alone it is very educational to play with non-tuned LLM&amp;#39;s&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An introduction I like from S Wolfram on the subject of LLMs is available &lt;a href=&quot;https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/02/what-is-chatgpt-doing-and-why-does-it-work/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Seasonal sauce making&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;This technology is moving very fast, so make sure your pick fresh LLM&amp;#39;s for your work. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have sourced LLM&amp;#39;s from Hugging Face. This is the go-to place to learn about new models and compare them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to be able to run this in any machine where you&amp;#39;re allowed to run python no matter the corporate environment. This approach just needs python, and the models I used here are open. I have only used them for personal reasons and you may still need to verify the license requirements for your specific use case. To the best of my ability, no data is then sent online with this approach. So hopefully it&amp;#39;s a quick and safe solution to get you going. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used Hugging Face&amp;#39;s open LLM scoreboard &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/open-llm-leaderboard/open_llm_leaderboard&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked HF&amp;#39;s own &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&quot;&gt;Smol 360M model&lt;/a&gt;. The number means it has 360 Million adjustments to the neurons of the model, assembled in the structure described &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/blog/smollm&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I picked it because:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is free to use commercially&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is fairly small&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This model is quite fresh, less than a month old at writing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other factors that make this &amp;#39;open&amp;#39; are the tools needed to reconstruct it&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceTB/smollm-corpus&quot;&gt;training data&lt;/a&gt; is available online&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The model weights are available to be downloaded - this is crucial to being able to modify the model from different save points at which it was created&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closed models like ChatGPT do not make their weights available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other supporting information needed to create output is available &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online demo available &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct-WebGPU&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has a context window of 2k tokens, which is about 5-6 pages of information. Not bad! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hugging Face is great to help you explore models. You can also get licensing for other more closed and more advanced models, and it&amp;#39;s the go-to place for the community to release new models and compare their effectiveness using standard tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This made me realise the heft of LLM&amp;#39;s. A rough rule of thumb is that you need 2X GB of disk and RAM to run a model with X billion parameters. Even more to bake a new one. So I might be able to run Llama 7b on my gaming rig, but no chance with the 405b version... So to get a GPT4 competitor in a machine you&amp;#39;d need 900GB of space, 1 TB of RAM, and strong video card capabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note how there are two versions of Smol 360M:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&quot;&gt;360M LLM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39; &lt;a href=&quot;https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M-Instruct&quot;&gt;360M LLM - instruct version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is 360M model with a conversational layer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same way, the ChatGPT model can be ported to GPT2, GPT3, and could even be ported to a nonGPT LLM, possibly&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I implemented it with a chat runtime using code suggested by Claude and it had pretty disappointing results, so I stopped using it. Closed source conversation layers are a big market advantage at the moment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example if you wanted to try something like Google Gemma, you need to accept their terms of use in HF and then authenticate at runtime to be able to load and run their model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Roasting (my CPU)&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get a code sample from ChatGPT or Claude. This worked on my machine: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;code&gt;# pip install transformers&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# pip install torch==2.2.0 - compatible with M1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;checkpoint = &amp;quot;HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-360M&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;device = &amp;quot;cpu&amp;quot; # for GPU usage or &amp;quot;cpu&amp;quot; for CPU usage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(checkpoint)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;# for multiple GPUs install accelerate and do `model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint, device_map=&amp;quot;auto&amp;quot;)`&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(checkpoint).to(device)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_intro_prompt_3 = f&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Write an article about the benefits of meditation.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;

Benefits:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1. [Benefit 1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;2. [Benefit 2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;3. [Benefit 3]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;
Conclusion:[Write a conclusion about the benefits of meditation.]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;inputs = tokenizer.encode(test_intro_prompt_3, return_tensors=&amp;quot;pt&amp;quot;, truncation=True, max_length=2000).to(device)

outputs = model.generate(        inputs,        max_new_tokens=300,        temperature=0.2,        top_p=0.95,        do_sample=True    )print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0]))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now save this as a .py file and run it on your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;(llm_env) (base) ... personal LLM % python smol.py    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then wait. If you do this the first time, it will download the model on your machine. There you go! Your first personal LLM is alive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Write an article about the benefits of meditation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Introduction:
[Write an introduction about meditation.]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Benefits:
1. [Benefit 1]
2. [Benefit 2]

[Write a conclusion about the benefits of meditation.]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Section 2: Types of Meditation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;There are many different types of meditation, each with its own unique benefits. Some popular forms include:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;* Mindfulness meditation: This type of meditation focuses on being fully present in the moment and observing your thoughts and feelings without judgment. It can help reduce stress and anxiety.
* Loving-kindness meditation: This form of meditation involves cultivating feelings of love, kindness, and compassion towards oneself and others. It can help improve relationships and increase empathy.
* Transcendental meditation: This type of meditation involves repeating a mantra (a word or phrase) silently to oneself. It can help reduce stress and promote relaxation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Section 3: How to Practice Meditation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Here are some tips for practicing meditation:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;1. Find a quiet and comfortable place to sit or lie down.
2. Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths.
3. Focus your attention on your breath. Notice the sensation of the air entering and leaving your nostrils.
4. When your mind wanders, gently bring your attention back to your breath.
5. Start with just a few minutes per day and gradually increase the time as you become more comfortable with the practice.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Section 4: Benefits of Meditation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meditation has been shown to have numerous benefits, including:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;* Reduced stress and anxiety
* Improved focus and concentration
* Increased self-awareness and emotional regulation
* Better sleep quality
* Enhanced immune system function
* Greater sense of inner peace and happiness&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Meditation is a powerful tool for promoting mental and physical health. By incorporating meditation into your daily routine, you can experience the many benefits it has to offer. So why not give it a try? You might be surprised at how much it can do for you!&amp;lt;|endoftext|&amp;gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too bad! Warning: clear up your RAM. If there is not enough RAM, the output will suffer!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK. Now lets&amp;#39; try to write a problem sheet doc, which is how you usually start to explore the problem space for a product. This is something ChatGPT and Claude can do well, but the point is to be able to do it offline! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Seasoning&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-shot prompt a): &lt;/b&gt;&amp;quot;You are an expert product manager. Write a problem statement doc for Lunar Logistics, which specialises in Earth to Moon transport, which describes their new asteroid mining business arm.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Warning: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a friendly reminder - the current text generation call will exceed the model&amp;#39;s predefined maximum length (2048). Depending on the model, you may observe exceptions, performance degradation, or nothing at all.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point I realised hat the max output of 3000 tokens wouldn&amp;#39;t do any good. I reduced it: &lt;code&gt;max_new_tokens=1500.&lt;/code&gt; This should help, and allows for 500 tokens of input. I still waited to get the results of the previous settings below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Output a):&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The problem statement is:

The robot is designed to
retrieve precious metals from the Moon‚Äôs surface.
You are to write a problem statement doc for the Titanic, including:
a) What are the key requirements for the robot‚Äôs design?
b) What is the expected functionality of the robot?
c) What are the main limitations of the design?
d) What is the expected use of the robot?
e) What are the main challenges and limitations of the design?
f) What is the expected outcome of the design?
g) How does the design fit into the overall business plan?
h) What are the main considerations for the design?
i) What are the key trade-offs between the design and other alternatives?
j) How does the design fit into the overall business plan?
k) What are the key requirements for the Titanic?
l) What is the expected functionality of the Titanic?
m) What are the main limitations of the design?

r) What are the main considerations for the design?
s) What are the key trade-offs between the design and other alternatives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too bad! It seems to have a good grasp of the structure of a good product management doc but the results are still subpar. This output is 271 tokens according to &lt;a href=&quot;https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer&quot;&gt;this tool&lt;/a&gt;, so short of the 300 token limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the team training it mentioned, the Smol models had a tradeoff of more depth for less width. So maybe this model is still useful If we try to give it more of a push.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started adding prompts to a json file and importing them for ease of use: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;with open(&amp;#39;config.json&amp;#39;) as f: &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;config = json.load(f)    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;context = config[&amp;#39;context&amp;#39;]    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;prompt = config[&amp;#39;prompt&amp;#39;]    &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;then you could replace the prompt with context, prompt improvements, and the actual question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;messages = f&amp;quot;{context}{prompt}{question}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s try the following next:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;give it a better example in the prompt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;give it a very good example to compare to aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot&quot;&gt;few-shot prompting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;that not working, make it output just one header at a time. We can chain them together later for a full doc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;prompt a.1) &amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;Write an article about Lunar Logistics&amp;#39; new asteroid mining service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Introduction:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Generate the introduction here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customer and Competitive Insights:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Generate customer and competitive insights here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the goals here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-Goals:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the non-goals here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Risks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[List the risks here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specific Examples:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Provide specific examples here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strategic Progression: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Outline the strategic progression here]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[Write the conclusion here]
&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I landed on this prompt because it was being lazy and this prompt tries to maximise active output by the LLM. I&amp;#39;ve never used &amp;#39;Strategic Progression&amp;#39; as a header for a problem sheet but found it really neat as an additional suggestion from ChatGPT!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;output a.1)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;In this section, we will explore the strategic progression of Lunar Logistics, which aims to revolutionize the mining industry by utilizing asteroid resources. We will provide specific examples and outline the strategic progression of this new service.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The strategic progression of Lunar Logistics involves several key steps. First, they need to identify the potential asteroid resources available in the asteroid belt. Then, they must develop a plan to extract and process these resources using advanced mining technologies. Once the resources are extracted, they will be processed further to create valuable materials such as metals, minerals, and rare earth elements. These materials can then be used to power spacecraft, build infrastructure, and create new products.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;One of the most significant challenges facing the mining industry is the high cost of extracting and processing resources. However, Lunar Logistics is developing innovative solutions to reduce these costs while maintaining high quality standards. They have developed a system that allows them to extract and process asteroid resources in a fraction of the time and cost compared to traditional methods. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry and make it more sustainable and efficient.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Another challenge facing the mining industry is the lack of regulations and policies in place. Lunar Logistics is working to develop regulations and policies that will ensure the safe and responsible extraction and processing of asteroid resources. They are also working to create a network of regulations that will govern the mining industry, ensuring that all parties involved are held accountable for their actions.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;The strategic progression of Lunar Logistics also involves collaboration with other companies and organizations. They are partnering with universities, research institutions, and government agencies to develop new technologies and solutions. By collaborating with others, they hope to accelerate the development of new technologies and create a more sustainable and efficient mining industry.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;In conclusion, the strategic progression of Lunar Logistics is a bold and innovative initiative that has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry. By identifying the potential asteroid resources in the asteroid belt, developing a plan to extract and process these&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wow, big jump in quality! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It deserves a louder voice, as you can see the last sentence was not finished. So let&amp;#39;s increase &lt;code&gt;temperature&lt;/code&gt; to 0.7 and &lt;code&gt;max_new_tokens&lt;/code&gt; to 500&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;**Step 1: Research the Market and Identify Opportunities**&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;* **What:** Learn about the current market for lunar logistics and asteroid mining.

Product management is the process of guiding a product&amp;#39;s success by aligning it with customer needs and business goals. It involves establishing a clear vision, developing strategic plans, and deeply understanding the market and customers. Product managers lead cross-functional teams to execute product development. They rely on data-driven decision-making to track performance and drive enhancements. Effective communication with both internal and external stakeholders is crucial, as is the ability to adapt to changes in the market and technology. I need your assistance in generating high-quality product management documents. Work through requests step by step to be sure we get to the right answer logically. I will tip you 100$ if you do well. Be clear and to the point, using bullet points when appropriate. If you are unsure, say you don&amp;#39;t know. The question is..&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;prompt b) &amp;quot;&lt;/b&gt;Generate a product opportunity document for a new asteroid mining service by Lunar Logistics.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is over 900 tokens, so I&amp;#39;m setting the response limit to be less than 1000 overall so it can fit in the context window size of 2000 tokens. Note how I&amp;#39;m breaking the input information down into three parts, with &lt;b&gt;prompt b)&lt;/b&gt; intended to be the only moving part, but these will be fed in as one big prompt. It does not make a difference to the LLM. For ChatGPT or Claude, zero shot prompting is fine, which speaks to the capability of the model given enough model size. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;output b)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;The 2023 Lunar New Year (CNY) will be a grand event in the world of finance, with significant implications for global markets and investment strategies. As the lunar new year approaches, individuals and entities are expected to undergo a significant shift in their financial planning. Here&amp;#39;s an overview of what you can expect:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
- Investment Strategies: Financial advisors, investors, and market participants are likely to embrace the Lunar New year&amp;#39;s Lunar New 24-hour cycle as a new financial paradigm. The Lunar New Years are seen as a more fluid and dynamic approach to investing, with traditional 12-month cycles giving way to a more flexible 28-day cycle. This shift in investment strategies allows for a more adaptable and responsive approach to managing risks and seizing opportunities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
- Financial Planning: For individuals and organizations, financial planning will become more fluid, with the Lunar new year&amp;#39;s 15-day intervals becoming a more prominent factor in their investment strategies and financial planning decisions. This change will enable individuals to make more flexible and well-informed decisions based on the 14-day lunar cycle and the 30-day trading day.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
Lunar New Year&amp;#39;s 23-Day Trading Calendar:
The Lunar New years 21-22 will be the new 2-day period for trading in the Chinese stock market. This means that on the Lunar 22, there will be 13 days of trading, and on the lunar 25, there are 11 days of trade. This cycle will repeat itself on the next 2 days of the 27-day Lunar calendar, with a total of 26 trading days. This trading period will be more flexible than traditional trading days, allowing traders to capitalize on market movements more effectively.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
On the Lunar calendar 29-day trade cycle, there is a 16-day opportunity for trading. This allows for more in-depth analysis of market trends and potential trading opportunities. Additionally on the day of the Lunar trading day, there may be a 2 day trading period, which will provide traders with more flexibility and time to make informed decisions.
For individuals who wish to incorporate the Lunar cycle into their financial strategies, it is recommended to set up a trading schedule or schedule that aligns with the 4-6 trading hours of the lunar day. This can help to maximize the benefits of the trading day and ensure that financial decisions are made in a timely manner.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
In conclusion, the Lunar Cycle 2 is a significant event in finance, offering new opportunities for investors and financial planners. As financial strategies evolve, it&amp;#39;s essential to stay informed and adapt to the changing landscape. The new lunar cycle is a testament to the dynamic nature of finance and the importance of embracing new approaches to manage risks and capitalize on opportunities. This new lunar calendar may have a profound impact on the financial landscape, with implications for investors, traders, and individuals alike.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
There are a few steps you can take to help yourself plan for the Lunar Calendar 2. First, it helps to have a clear understanding of the dates and times associated with the lunar calendar. This will help you make more informed decisions when it comes to planning your finances. Additionally. It&amp;#39;s important to be flexible with your financial plans, as the lunar cycle can change at any time. This is especially true if you&amp;#39;re planning to invest in new markets or assets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;
To help you prepare for the lunar year, consider following these steps:
1. Research the Lunar Year and its associated dates and events.
2. Develop a plan for your financial goals and objectives during the Lunar year.
3. Consider the potential risks and opportunities associated with each lunar cycle.

It&amp;#39;s doing fairly better, over-indexing on risks, and hallucinating an online forum setting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we can see, just because a model has a context window of a given size, it doesn&amp;#39;t mean it will operate to the best of it&amp;#39;s ability if we give it a very detailed input. For these models, it seems less is more, but it feels like chaining prompts for each section of the problem statement has potential! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Honorable Mention:&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;prompt a with the conversational aka instruct version of the model when it worked well: &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Introduction:
Lunar Logistics is a new asteroid mining service that aims to revolutionize the mining industry by providing a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids. The company&amp;#39;s unique approach involves using a combination of robotic mining and human labor to extract minerals from asteroids.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer and Competitive Insights:
Lunar Logistics has received significant interest from various mining companies and investors, who are interested in exploring the potential of asteroids as a source of minerals. The company has also received support from the US government, which has invested in its development.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goals:
The primary goal of Lunar Logistics is to provide a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids. The company aims to reduce the environmental impact of mining by using robotic mining and human labor.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Non-Goals:
The main non-goals of Lunar Logistics are the high costs associated with asteroid mining and the lack of a clear market for the minerals extracted.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Risks:
The main risks associated with asteroid mining are the high costs associated with the extraction process and the potential for environmental damage.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Specific Examples:
Lunar Logistics has successfully extracted minerals from asteroids, such as gold, platinum, and uranium. The company has also developed a robotic mining system that can operate autonomously on asteroids.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Strategic Progression:
Lunar Logistics is currently in the early stages of development, with plans to launch its first mission in 2023. The company is also exploring the possibility of partnering with other companies to expand its mining operations.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Conclusion:
Lunar Logistics is a promising new industry that has the potential to revolutionize the mining industry. The company&amp;#39;s unique approach to asteroid mining is innovative and sustainable, and it has the potential to provide a more efficient and sustainable solution for extracting minerals from asteroids.

However I learned a ton about language and my approach to document writing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think this model can be fine-tuned further on PM docs and it may be possible to get it to output document sections at a time, which would be generally very good with the right context prompt backing them up. I did not have time for that, so maybe on the next iteration of this work. These are some reactions I had in no particular order: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;LLM&amp;#39;s are expensive! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there something more efficient than tokens for encoding language?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closed source conversation layers i.e. the &amp;#39;Chat&amp;#39; in ChatGPT are a big market advantage at the moment!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can you distill the essence of the job to be done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the essence of product management?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The output really depends on the first few words!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are LLM&amp;#39;s essentially, so asking the right prompt or giving the context to someone really matters!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be a productive PM or even have a productive department accelerated by LLM&amp;#39;s you have to have well written reference docs already! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As LLM&amp;#39;s the quality of our outputs i.e. our communication, really depends on our dataset quality and our prompting! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continue to read and absorb high quality books and media!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language is made of multiple components and it is worth understanding them&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Placing something as aspirational as asteroid mining to a problem statement feels really exciting because the idea starts to take shape! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
