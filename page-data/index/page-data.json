It can be reasonable to choose either for different reasons, especially when you don’t have the resources to migrate all your content across formats.\n\n[Google wants to avoid the favourite game. ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=14&v=uJGDyAN9g-g)However because of pushes for better user privacy [(WebKit’s ITP 2.1)](https://webkit.org/blog/8613/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-1/) affecting Safari users (and Firefox not far behind), it will be more valuable to switch to or start working with **Subfolders ** in 2019 for Web Analytics. This trickles down to SEO, of course, and a few key SEO community members have been giving stronger reasons for subfolders already. \n\n### What is the difference between subdomains and subfolders?\n\nBoth are ways to help you organise your site content. You can easily identify them:\n\nRoot domain: site.com\n\nSub**domain**: blog.site.com\n\nSub**folder**: site.com/blog\n\nSubdomains can feel like an appendage to the site. Be it a login portal, geo-specific content, a product or a marketing one-nighter page that is distinct enough to be elected to be a \"subthing\".site.com\n\nSubfolders will work inside the site, effectively using the same subdomain. Different websites will populate them with sections, categories, product types and so on until you reach the page you need.\n\n### How is WebKit's change different this time?\n\n> With ITP 2.1, all persistent client-side cookies, i.e. persistent cookies created through document.cookie, are capped to a **seven day expiry**.\n\n[As explained by Simo Ahava](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/itp-2-1-and-web-analytics/), this will affect every JavaScript-based method of tracking. It is a culmination of steps aimed at 3rd party tracking using ITP. But due to misuse of 1st party cookie privileges (to better sell you ads), now anything using JS to set document.cookie will be in the firing line aimed at AdTech.\n\n### Analytics for the subdomain setup will suffer as a result\n\n1) You visit blog.site.com  \n2) blog.site.com writes a first party cookie on the root domain  \n3) Other subdomains can access the root domain cookie and happily recognise you  \n\nThis is a legitimate use of a first-party cookie. It makes sense to preserve the user identity across these for a better user experience and correct analytics.\n\nThe new Safari update will break the second step by automatically purging any first party cookie after seven days. This will inflate new users across subdomains and your Web Analyst will be unhappy with degradation in the data. Depending on the share of iOS users for your product, this will affect conversion funnels and other time and engagement based metrics.\n\nSimo's post mentions a **localStorage ** workaround. There's also talks of server-side cookie drop methods relying on the HTTP response, using either a server or CDN services that let you run JS to intercept traffic and drop a cookie. A third group of suggestions revolves around re-routing traffic such as CNAME pointing to a cookie dispenser service or a similar reverse proxy solution. These solutions requiring server overhead would most likely not be available on the free version of Google Analytics.\n\nGoogle and Adobe have not formally responded to analytics impacting changes in ITP 2.1. [Apple's recent removal of the Facebook Research App](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/apple-bans-facebook-vpn/ ) seems to be aligned with this update in showing a hardened view towards user data collection.\n\n*Tracking for subfolders will work as usual and won't be affected by ITP 2.1*\n\n### Why SEO is harder with subdomains\n\nNew users correlate strongly with organic traffic. An effective SEO keyword strategy will need the planner to be aware of what keywords the site is ranking well, and not so well for, and what the user might be actually looking for when they search for those keywords. Unless there are hundreds of thousands of monthly users coming to different subdomains:\n\na) Search keyword quantity and quality will be diluted across subdomains and reduce their cumulative 'domain authority'\n\nb1) A search engine crawler knows for sure that content in a subfolder belongs to the site it sits in\n\nb2) But it can consider a subdomain as a [completely separate site.](https://backlinko.com/hub/seo/urls) \n\nc) external SEO efforts to get good backlinks - an important signal for search engines, can be much more focused on a subdomain format\n\nWhile a) and b) can be good arguments for using subdomains go get more qualified leads, you can't avoid the dilution in backlinks. If there are a lot of users already being serviced by a subdomain however, it would be best to improve it slowly with experiments if needed.\n\n### How much can a subdomain impact your brand?\n\nMaybe your company has a help center, an AMP setup, or a login portal. It sits in a different subdomain. Maybe they're managed by a different team. Maybe its hosted on different servers. Maybe there is some tech debt on the login and state save experience. The front end definitely does not look the same as the main site. Or maybe this is happening on an app that could use some love.\n\nLittle by little this discrepancy in features chips away at your brand. [Branding has intrinsic value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand_awareness), worth billions of dollars in advertising, capable of helping you sell your £1000+ phone with a 50%+ profit margin and help you stay in the mind of the customer when they flick their low power 3–5 option mental rolodex in search of a local plumber.\n\n> *It is incredibly important for your URL slug to look good - it is part of your brand*\n\nYour URL slug must be short, have the main SEO keyword, use dashes and be modestly future proof. These are some of the main features leading the user to\n\nsite.com/section/relevant-news-article-title\n\nand away from\n\nsite.com/default/section/2018/07/19/trying_to_be_relevant_but_not_really\n\nHaving a subdomain appendage on the left is not economical for UX. It creates more visual clutter than subfolders. The shorter the time taken to understand a search engine entry, the closer we get to the click.\n\nIf you want to geo-localise something, just use the TLD for that country i.e. site.co.uk or site.co.jp . Bad or non existing SEO decisions, much like with branding, can take months to years to fix.\n\n### Conclusion: Subfolders can help with unification\n\nWorking towards one single domain with subfolders can help remove silos and focus your company from data to product features and branding. The holy grail here is a unified user experience with global user IDs and personalised value delivery.\n\nAs much as cookie wars rage in the future, there is something utterly valuable in having a loyal, logged in user. We should strive to provide them as much value as possible for that 'logged-in' experience, even if that happens offline.\n\na) Online branding will be stronger, with every sensory input designed to keep brand recal of your service or product as high as possible\n\nb) UX Designers and Product Managers will be able to move on from the main navigation and task completions to running experiments and strategise\n\nc) Developers will have less code to maintain and refactor, not pull their hair over four and a half login experiences and will have more time to focus on security\n\nd) Data managers will have less pipelines to maintain. Even if one day they need a satellite network to tag users they will only have to do it for one domain. The data will be cleaner and so will be funnels, insights and ML models.\n\ne) Not to mention cheaper and more efficient running costs for advanced tracking & analytics, CMS, cookie consent management and any other tech integration","desc":"The subdomains VS subfolders debate has been running in the SEO underground for a few years.
